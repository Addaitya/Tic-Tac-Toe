    The game starts with 'X'. User has to input the postion. Position in game board is shown below:
                                           
                                           1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3
                                           ----+-----+-----
                                           2 1 | 2 2 | 2 3
                                           ----+-----+-----
                                           3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3
                
   Let me explain you by example:
   
                     
                     |  |
                   --+--+--
                     |  |
                   --+--+--
                     |  |
                    
                    Enter the value of X: 1 1       //(this "1 1" is user input)
                    
                    X|  |
                   --+--+--
                     |  |
                   --+--+--
                     |  |  
                     
                     Enter the value of O: 2 1
                     
                    X|  |
                   --+--+--
                    0|  |
                   --+--+--
                     |  |
                     
            It will continue lie this untill either 'X' wins or 'O' wins or match ties.
